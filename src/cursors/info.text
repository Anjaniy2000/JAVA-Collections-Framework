Important Points: Please note that initially, any iterator reference will point to the index just before the index of the first element in a collection.
                  We donâ€™t create objects of Enumeration, Iterator, ListIterator because they are interfaces.
                  We use methods like elements(), iterator(), listIterator() to create objects.
                  These methods have an anonymous Inner Class that extends respective interfaces and return this class object.

Note: The $ symbol in reference class name is a proof that concept of inner classes is used and these class objects are created.
